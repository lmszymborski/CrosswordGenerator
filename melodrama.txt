You asked if I was feelin' it
I'm psycho high
No, you won't remember in the morning
When I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home
But who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
Our only wish is melodrama
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gunfights and the limelights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
