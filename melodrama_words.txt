You
asked
if
I
was
feelin'
it
I'm
psycho
high
No,
you
won't
remember
in
the
morning
When
speak
my
mind
Lights
are
on
and
they've
gone
home
But
who
am
I?
Oh,
how
fast
evening
passes
Cleaning
up
champagne
glasses
We
told
this
melodrama
Our
only
wish
is
And
terror
horror
we
wonder
why
bother,
whoa,
whoa
God,
All
glamour
trauma
fuckin'
melodrama,
gunfights
limelights
holy
sick
divine
nights,
They'll
talk
about
us,
all
lovers
How
kissed
killed
each
other,
discover
wanted
something
that
offered
